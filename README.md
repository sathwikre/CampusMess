# 🍽️ CampusMess — A Daily Mess Menu Portal for Hostel Students

## 💡 The Inspiration

> *“What’s today’s mess menu?”*  
> *“Did anyone check breakfast?”*  
> *“I already went outside… now I have to ask someone.”*

In our hostels, **there is no fixed or easily accessible mess menu**.  
Every single day, students face the same frustrations:

- Asking friends or seniors about the food
- Calling someone just to know the menu
- Going out without knowing what’s being served
- Feeling lazy to ask repeatedly
- No single trusted place to check today’s mess items

We realized this small daily inconvenience wastes time and energy for **hundreds of students**.

That’s where **CampusMess** comes in.

- Images are uploaded to **Cloudinary**
- Each menu is tagged with the current date

### 3️⃣ Auto Expiry

  - Hostel (Ellora, Hampi, Shilpa, Ajantha, etc.)
